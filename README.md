## The project

This is kinda fun for me to play with php...
But I think php miss some features and standards (especially for strings).

I tought the object type are kinda usefull so here we go...

I'm going to make some implementations of Arr (Array), Char (or maybe not, it's like String),
Float, Int and String.

**The project is under development so it's not near to be usable ! :wink:**

## Use

All classes are in the namespace ClassTypes so the easiest way to use it is
to use it like that :

```php
use ClassTypes\Arr;
use ClassTypes\Char;
use ClassTypes\Float;
use ClassTypes\Int;
use ClassTypes\String;
use ClassTypes\Va;
```

## Documentation

Documentation will come when the project will be released...
